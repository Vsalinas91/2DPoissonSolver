2D Poisson Solver:
---------
This notebook contains a simple 2D Poisson Solver that uses the a Jacobian solutiont to model the electric field, and potential 
for a parallel-plate capacitor model.

This model can be expanded to solve for other arbitrary geometries, but will require future revisions to enable this functionality.
Original solver source is cited in the notebook.
